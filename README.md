Note: this blog post is one of the first references to NSubstitute
<br />
I could not find NSubstitute.dll on the Asset Store or download via the Package Manager in Visual Studio
<br />
However, I did see there was a reference here:
<br />
TestDoublesBlogpost/Assets/UnityTestTools/UnitTesting/Editor/NSubstitute/
<br />
<br />
Therefore, I copied this DLL directly into the Plugins directory in all projects in this repo!
